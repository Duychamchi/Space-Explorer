2D Unity Game: Space Explorer
Objectives
Understand and apply GameObject management in Unity.
Get familiar with essential Components such as Rigidbody2D, Collider2D, and SpriteRenderer.
Practice C# scripting for movement, shooting, and interaction.
Learn about the 2D collision system (Collision & Trigger).
Implement scene management (Scenes), UI, and audio integration.
Game Concept
The player controls a spaceship in space, avoiding and destroying asteroids to earn points. The game utilizes fundamental Unity elements such as movement controls, collisions, random object spawning, and a score system.

Game Components
A. Player (Spaceship)
Unity Concepts Applied:
Transform – Defines the position, rotation, and scale of the spaceship.
Rigidbody2D – Adds physics for smooth movement.
Collider2D – Detects collisions with asteroids and enemy bullets.
Script – Handles movement, shooting, and health reduction when colliding.
Functionalities:
Move using W, A, S, D keys.
Shoot bullets using the Spacebar.
Lose health when colliding with enemies or asteroids.
B. Enemies (Asteroids)
Randomly spawn from the top of the screen and fall downward.
Use Prefabs to generate multiple asteroids from a template.
Apply Collider2D to detect collisions with bullets and the player.
Asteroids have health; the player must shoot and maneuver to destroy them.
C. Bullets
The player uses bullets to destroy enemies.
Script handles straight movement and self-destruction when leaving the screen.
Uses Collider2D (IsTrigger) to detect collisions.
D. Scoring System
Stars randomly appear on the screen.
When the spaceship collides with a star, the player earns 10 points.
Each destroyed asteroid grants 1 point.
After collecting a star, it disappears, and the score increases.
Game Over occurs when the player collides with an asteroid.
E. User Interface (UI)
Displays the game title, background, and buttons for Start and Help.
The game includes a tutorial to guide the player.
If the player collides with an enemy, the screen shows the score and Game Over message, with an option to restart.
Future Improvements
